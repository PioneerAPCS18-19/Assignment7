# Assignment 7

For assignment 7 you will be creating a program with multiple classes for the first time. This particular program manipulates integers in a few ways which include:

1. Getting the sum of the digits
2. Getting the nth digit
3. Reversing the digits

You will also need some helper methods for achieving these tasks and some basic getters and setters.

## Part 1

Get the classes set up in BlueJ, create instance variables, create a constructor, and work on the `getDigitSum` method.

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
